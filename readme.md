# Teach Yourself Day
## - Why did you choose this subject?
- I chose this subject out a real interest in iOS development. I would love to work as an iOS devloper, or at least have the skills to work on iOS projects on the side.
## - What problem does it solve?
- It's a modern language designed to read intuitively like English that can be used in development on all Apple platforms like iOS or tvOS etc.
## - Why does one use it?
- It is used in development of all Apple software. It was released in 2010 and has since overtaken C in terms of popularity for Apple/iOS development.
### - What are the alternatives?/What is it similar to, if anything?
- The alternative would be to write in Objective-C, which is very similar but less user-friendly and intuitive. It is still strongly-typed and very similar to Objective-C.
## - What is the history of this technology?
- It was developed by and is maintained by Apple Inc.
## - What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
- The overall concepts are familiar to me - OOP, methods, properties (instance variables) etc., but some things will definitely take some getting used to. For example, the concept of Optionals and the strong declarations are new to me.
## - What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?
- Using Xcode was completely new to me, and manipulating with the UI is very different. At least from what I have learned so far, manipulating the UI was done through a GUI.
## - What resources do you recommend for interested students?
- I watched the online lectures from Stanford on YouTube for app development in iOS.
## - What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?
- The Stanford lectures mentioned above are quite helpful, and the very first lecture talks you through setting up your first Swift app in Xcode from scratch through to having something working on a simulated iPhone.
## - What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?
- What are Optionals and how might they be used?
- What is the difference between an external and an internal name for a parameter?
- What is an example of a property observer in Swift?
